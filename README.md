## Introduction

Hi i am Mac , a 3rd-year Engineering student at KMUTT ( University in Thailand ). I am driven in Electronics Engineering Field (as a  Hardware Engineer) , i just obey my passion then i desin my ASIC/IC-Design about Gate control of H Bridge Driver that can use to Motor-Drive , Non-Inverting-Buck-Boost Converter , Inverter  ,and etc.

**Note:**
For Simulation and IC- Layout , i use STD-Cell from C5 model in [Electric_VLSI Library](https://github.com/XACKIES/MAC101-Chip-H-Bridge-Gate-Controller-/tree/main/Electric_VLSI)


## Application 
- DC Motor Driver
- Inverter (DC/AC)
- Non Inverting Buck Boost Converter (NIBB - Converter)
